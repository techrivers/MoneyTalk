# Project Setup

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run this project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Git

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

```
bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>

```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository and `<project_directory>` with the name of the cloned directory.

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```
bash
    npm install

```

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the listed dependencies.

3.  **Start the development server:**

    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. Refer to the `package.json` file for the specific script to start the server. Common script names include `dev`, `start`, or `serve`.

    For example, if the `package.json` has a `dev` script, you would run:

```
bash
    npm run dev

```

If the script is `start`, you would run:

```
bash
    npm start

```

The development server should now be running, and you can access the project in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

Refer to the `package.json` file for a complete list of available npm scripts and their descriptions.

## Environment Variables (Webhook URL)

To manage sensitive information and environment-specific configurations like the webhook URL, create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory of the project.

Add the webhook URL to this file in the following format:

NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=https://www.google.com

Refer to the `package.json` file for a complete list of available npm scripts and their descriptions.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, you typically use a build script defined in `package.json`. A common script name is `build`:

```
bash
npm run build
```

This will create optimized production-ready files, usually in a `dist` or `build` directory.

## Further Information

- Consult the `package.json` file for specific project scripts and configurations.
- Refer to the `docs/blueprint.md` for project blueprint information.

Steps to Import and Configure
Import the Workflow JSON

Open your n8n instance.

Go to the top right corner and click on Import.

Upload the provided .json file.

Set Required Workflow Variables

After import, the following variables and credentials must be configured before running the workflow:

ðŸ”¹ 1. companyID Variable
Go to the Webhook or any relevant node using companyID.

Set the appropriate QBO companyID (also known as realm ID).

ðŸ”¹ 2. OpenAI Credentials
Go to Credentials (left sidebar â†’ Credentials).

Add your OpenAI API Key.

Assign it to the OpenAI node in the workflow.

ðŸ”¹ 3. QuickBooks Online (QBO) Credentials
Go to Credentials.

Create or select your QBO OAuth2 credentials (with proper client ID, client secret, and redirect URI).

Assign it to all nodes interacting with QBO (e.g., HTTP Request nodes or QBO-specific integrations).

ðŸš€ You're Ready!
Once the above configurations are complete, activate your webhook and test the workflow by triggering it via your defined endpoint.
