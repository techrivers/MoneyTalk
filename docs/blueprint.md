# **App Name**: Webhook Chat

## Core Features:

- Message Display: Displays messages in a chronological order, similar to standard chat applications.
- Input Field: Text input area for users to type and send messages to the webhook.
- Webhook Communication: Handles sending user messages to the specified webhook URL and retrieves the response.
- Loading State and Basic Input Handling: Shows loading indicator while waiting for the response from the webhook. Prevents the form from sending the message again, and can also limit the message count within a period.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#778DA9) for a calm and reliable feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#E0E1DD). Gives a muted, clean background for the chat interface.
- Accent color: Vivid orange (#E29578). Use for interactive elements such as send button and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, offering a modern, clean look, for body and headlines.
- Use minimalist icons for actions like sending messages and displaying status.
- Messages are clearly separated, with user messages on one side and webhook responses on the other, in a standard chat layout.
- Use subtle animations for loading states and message transitions.
